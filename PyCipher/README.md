# PyCipher

A custom cipher program I made for fun. No specific structure like a
Ceasar Cipher or a Polybius square, but random rotation of letters.

You can both encode [w/Random seed], and decode [w/ Brute Force]. The code is hilariously easy
to crack.

This project is from my older account, Ale-XYX. Ive since mirrored it and added comments.

# JCipher

This is an updated version of my older PyCipher program, effectively the same, but with some minor design tweaks and written in java.
I should have used the more modern JavaFX instead of Swing but I didn't know that existed. Whoops.

Minor Improvements Include:
- More conistency with enabled/disabled buttons
- New Design

The file structure and codebase in general leave much to be desired, but it was the first project I attempted with java.

To run this, cd into the JCipher directory and do:

`javac JCipher.java`

and then

`java JCipher`

Otherwise this is unremarkable, just a learning project.
